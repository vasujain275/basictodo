# basicTodo

A basic todo app with a backend built in Express.js, using MongoDB for the database, and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML for the frontend.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple todo application that allows users to manage their tasks. The app is built using a combination of Express.js for the backend server, MongoDB as the database, and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML for the frontend.

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as a learning experience for the contributors, @vasujain275 and @jatingupta1204. They are focusing on different aspects of the application development and expanding their skills in the following areas:

- @vasujain275:
  - Backend Development: By working on the Express.js backend, @vasujain275 is gaining hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs, handling HTTP requests, and implementing CRUD operations using Express.js.
  - MongoDB Integration: @vasujain275 is learning how to connect and interact with a MongoDB database, including storing and retrieving data related to the todo tasks.
  - Vanilla JavaScript: Instead of using a modern framework like React, @vasujain275 has chosen to work with vanilla JS to understand the inner workings and concepts of pre-React era web development.

- @jatingupta1204:
  - Frontend Styling: @jatingupta1204 is responsible for the visual design and styling of the todo app. This includes using CSS to enhance the user interface, creating responsive layouts, and ensuring a consistent and appealing user experience.
  - UI/UX Design: @jatingupta1204 is focusing on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface, considering factors such as usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.
